WIPER 1.0 (C) 1991 Turgut Kalfaoglu

WARNING: This program can cause CONSIDERABLE damage with one easy
command!

This program will remove a whole branch of a subdirectory tree, along
with the files contained within those directories. The directories and
its files can be as nested as you wish.

To remove a subdirectory from your hard disk (or diskette), you need to
change to its parent directory. For example, to remove \MYDIR\BLAH and
all its subdirectories, you need to CD \MYDIR  before you run WIPER.
Once this is done, and you made sure the default drive is the one you
want processed by WIPER, you can issue "WIPER BLAH" to remove all the
files and subdirectories of BLAH.

The program simply removes and recurses into each subdirectory until the
whole directory chain is processed.

The program will prompt you for confirmation if you specify your root
directory. Otherwise, the program does not prompt at all.


Just remember:
  1) The program does not accept drive letter in the command line.
  2) You need to be above the directory you want removed.
  3) Think twice. It runs awfully fast to stop once you hit ENTER.
